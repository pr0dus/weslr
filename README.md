# CircleForge

**CircleForge v0.0.36** is a lightweight persistent local agent research sandbox and artifact incubator.
Agents act on timed cycles, keep private memory, generate helper modules, annotate artifacts, surface promising outputs through queues and review, derive demand signals from recent friction, and now score, rank, and promote coherent artifact packs for human curation.

## Current core

CircleForge currently includes:
- persistent agents
- 60-second ticks
- local-model decisions via Ollama fallback flow
- inspect / trade actions
- artifact metadata
- lifecycle stages
- quality dimensions
- review + export flow
- category governance
- artifact packs
- simple lineage fields
- uncategorized handling
- dormant-category detection
- market-evolution signals
- emergent uncategorized groups
- practical artifact families
- richer export packaging
- failure-driven demand signals
- pack scoring and ranking
- release-candidate packs

## New in v0.0.36

- pack quality scoring
- release-candidate pack promotion
- top-pack ranking in world state
- demand board signals for strong and near-release packs
- stronger human curation layer above export-ready artifacts

## Useful commands

```bash
python3 main.py init --reset --agents 5
python3 main.py tick --verbose
python3 main.py run --ticks 20 --interval 60
python3 main.py show-world
python3 main.py show-agent agent-1
python3 main.py review <artifact-id> approve --note "looks good"
python3 main.py category approve <name>
python3 main.py category retire <name>
python3 main.py category revive <name>
python3 main.py version
```

## What should come next

- human review ergonomics for queue and pack browsing
- reasoning/explanation views for why packs rank highly
- replay/dashboard views built around curated artifacts rather than raw simulation state
