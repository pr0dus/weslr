# CircleForge

**CircleForge v0.0.37** is a lightweight persistent local agent research sandbox and artifact incubator.
Agents act on timed cycles, keep private memory, generate helper modules, annotate artifacts, surface promising outputs through queues and review, derive demand signals from recent friction, score and rank coherent artifact packs for human curation, and now estimate commercial readiness and sellability.

## Current core

CircleForge currently includes:
- persistent agents
- 60-second ticks
- local-model decisions via Ollama fallback flow
- inspect / trade actions
- artifact metadata
- lifecycle stages
- quality dimensions
- review + export flow
- category governance
- artifact packs
- simple lineage fields
- uncategorized handling
- dormant-category detection
- market-evolution signals
- emergent uncategorized groups
- practical artifact families
- richer export packaging
- failure-driven demand signals
- pack scoring and ranking
- release-candidate packs
- commercial qualification signals
- sellability scoring

## New in v0.0.37

- artifact-level commercial qualification and sellability scores
- pack-level commercial readiness and buyer-facing signals
- target-user and price-band guesses for artifacts and packs
- demand-board signals for promising sellable outputs
- stronger bridge from internal curation to monetizable packaging

## Useful commands

```bash
python3 main.py init --reset --agents 5
python3 main.py tick --verbose
python3 main.py run --ticks 20 --interval 60
python3 main.py show-world
python3 main.py show-agent agent-1
python3 main.py review <artifact-id> approve --note "looks good"
python3 main.py category approve <name>
python3 main.py category retire <name>
python3 main.py category revive <name>
python3 main.py version
```

## What should come next

- human review ergonomics for queue and pack browsing
- reasoning/explanation views for why artifacts and packs look sellable
- replay/dashboard views built around curated artifacts rather than raw simulation state
